# Ignition Module Simulator
  

### General
This file simulates the becoming part of ignition module 
where the module makes it possible for ignition to 
communicate with a .Net based server. 

The communication is done using pipes. It means 
this Java code and the .net based client should run at the same machine, i.e. the client
that is developed in C# programming language and communicates 
with the server though NetTcpBinding, will bring the data for itself 
and also for the java client. The java client request a specific data trough piping
and the .net based client will send the response i.e. the requested data.
